                <p>Kids can stay safe by remembering a few simple things:
                            Always tell a trusted adult if someone makes them uncomfortable
                            Say 'no' if something feels wrong.
                            Remember that their body is private.
                            It's important to talk to grown-ups whom you trust about anything that worries or confuses you.
